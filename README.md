# Web Development Peer Assignment

## CRUD, PHP, SQL

### The task is to complete the PHP application we started creating for Professor Xavier. 
His requirement is to have a fully functional system through which he can manage the heroes on his
team. The web application you will create should allow him to:
1. List all heroes
2. Retrieve the details of any individual hero
3. Update the details of a hero
4. Delete a hero
Professor Xavier does not want his enemies to tamper with his database. You will therefore have to create
an authentication system with a username and password so that only authorized users can perform create,
update and delete operations on the database. Any user should be able to read data from the database however.
